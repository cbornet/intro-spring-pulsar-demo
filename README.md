# Introducing Spring for Apache Pulsar 

## Live Demo - User Registration 

This is a simple Spring for Apache Pulsar application that takes a simple produce/consume use case through the following:
- Imperative produce/consume (user to/from user-topic)
- Improve the above usage w/ topic detection and config props
- Reactive produce/consume (single)
- Reactive produce/consume (stream)
- Add Spring Cloud Stream binder to process messages

There is a commit for each of the above steps.
